# List of GitHub repositories and users to be backed up
#
# Lines that look like GitHub HTTPS repositories (e.g.,
# https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git) will be backed up
# individually.
#
# Lines that look like GitHub user URLs (https://github.com/octocat)
# will be expanded into a list of that user's public repositories.
#
#
# NOTE: Removing repositories from this file will result in those
# repositories being removed from the archive next time the program is
# run.
#

# Example
https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git
